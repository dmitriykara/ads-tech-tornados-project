The system starts by receiving a request to modify the current resource allocation policy. This request typically comes from an external source, such as a user or an automated system that detects the need for policy updates. Once the request is received, the system validates it, ensuring that all necessary parameters are included and that the request complies with predefined rules and formats. If the request is deemed invalid, it is promptly rejected, and no further actions are taken.

If the request passes validation, the system proceeds to check the current usage of resources, comparing it against the predefined resource limits specified in the current allocation policy. If the system detects that the resource limits have been exceeded, it triggers a resource adjustment process. During this process, resources are reallocated to ensure they fall within the acceptable limits.

Following the reallocation, the system applies the new allocation policy, ensuring that the changes take effect. Additionally, the configurations of the Pods are updated to reflect the new resource distribution, and the Pods are notified of these updates. All changes are meticulously logged for future reference and auditing purposes. Finally, the system saves the updated allocation policy, completing the process.
