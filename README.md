# Advanced Software Design project
# Team name: Tech Tornados

## Summary

The "Load Balancer with Service Turn-Off" project aims to enhance the functionality of a vanilla Kubernetes (k8s) distribution by enabling it to scale applications down to zero instances when they are not in use. This is particularly relevant for machine learning (ML) applications that often have unique computational requirements and can be slow to start. The service will use advanced, event-driven automata to manage application scaling in response to real-time monitoring data, optimizing resource usage and ensuring that applications can scale up quickly when needed.

## Stakeholders

1. DevOps Engineers

    Responsible for managing Kubernetes clusters and ensuring high availability and scalability of applications.

2. ML Engineers and Data Scientists

    Require efficient and scalable infrastructure to deploy and manage model training and inference tasks.

3. System Administrators

    Oversee the underlying infrastructure and ensure optimal resource allocation and utilization.

4. Cloud Service Providers

    Provide the necessary infrastructure and want to offer value-added services to improve customer satisfaction.

5. Product Managers

    Aim to optimize costs and improve performance for applications running on the Kubernetes infrastructure.

6. End Users

    Benefit from improved performance and reduced latency of the applications they use.

## Expected Needs

1. Cost Efficiency

    Ability to reduce operational costs by scaling unused application instances to zero.

2. Performance

    Ensuring that applications scale up quickly from zero to meet demand without significant latency.

3. Resource Optimization

    Better utilization of underlying computational resources, particularly for ML applications.

4. Ease of Integration

    Seamlessly integrate with existing Kubernetes environments without requiring significant configuration changes.

5. Reliability

    Highly reliable scaling mechanisms that react appropriately to real-time monitoring events.

6. Security

    Ensure that the scaling service does not introduce vulnerabilities to the deployment.


## Features

1. Zero-Single Scaling

    Allow applications to scale down to zero instances when not in use and automatically scale up when required.

2. Event-Driven Scaling

    Use complex event processing to trigger scaling actions based on defined monitoring metrics and thresholds.

3. Custom Resource Allocation

    Tailor the allocation of compute resources specifically for ML applications, ensuring they get the necessary resources when scaling up.

4. Integration with Monitoring Tools

    Seamlessly integrate with existing monitoring tools to gather real-time data for making scaling decisions.

5. Dashboards and Alerts

    Provide user-friendly dashboards to visualize scaling events and performance metrics, and set up alerts for critical events.

6. Automata-Based Policy Engine

    Implement a robust policy engine to define scaling rules using complex automata, providing flexibility and precision.

7. API for Customization

    Offer an API that allows for customization and tuning of the scaling algorithms to fit specific application needs.

## Constraints

1. Latency

    Ensuring minimal latency when scaling from zero to active instances, especially for ML applications which can be resource-intensive.

2. Compatibility

    Must be compatible with a wide range of Kubernetes distributions and configurations, without requiring extensive modifications.

3. Scalability

    The solution must manage high levels of concurrency and large clusters efficiently.

4. Security

    Must adhere to security best practices and compliance requirements to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

5. Resource Limits

    Operate within the constraints of available computational resources and quotas set by cloud providers.

6. Reliability

    Ensure high availability and fault tolerance within the scaling service itself to prevent outages or scaling mishaps.

7. Complexity:

    The service should aim to minimize complexity to avoid steep learning curves for users integrating it into their environments.

    This structure provides a comprehensive framework for implementing a load balancing service with the ability to scale applications to zero instances, tailored for environments requiring efficient resource management and rapid scaling capabilities, particularly in the context of ML applications.
